I have followed Chris for many years so it was a real honor to be there in person during one of his talks. The theme of the talk was SVG (scalable vector graphics) and he did a great job of talking about the history, why we should now use SVG and how we can use them today.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) since 1999. SVG images and their behaviors are defined in XML text files. In much simpler terms, an SVG is a type of image which can be used on the web and if chosen wisely can provide much smaller file sizes than traditional Jpeg or other compressed image formats. It reduces the need to provide multiple image sizes as it scales dynamically, growing and shrinking automatically, adapting to its environment.<\/p>\n<p>SVG is now the recommended solution for icons on the web, replacing icon fonts as the de facto standard. Browser support is now<a href=\"http:\/\/caniuse.com\/#search=svg\"><span>\u00a0<\/span>excellent<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>and even for older browsers like IE8, there are<a href=\"https:\/\/css-tricks.com\/a-complete-guide-to-svg-fallbacks\/\"><span>\u00a0<\/span>techniques<\/a><span>\u00a0<\/span>you can use. A build tool like Grunt or Gulp was recommended to automate SVG generation. For example, you can combine multiple SVG\u2019s into one sprite sheet, which will save on file size and the number of requests the browser needs to make.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-784\" src=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-1024x641.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-1024x641.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-300x188.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-768x480.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-585x365.jpg 585w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-663x415.jpg 663w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-1326x829.jpg 1326w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-481x301.jpg 481w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-962x602.jpg 962w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier-1536x961.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashingconf-barcelona-chriscoyier.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I found this talk to be exceptionally reaffirming, as all of the techniques Chris outlined were techniques we already use at Beyond, so it was great to see that we are keeping ahead of the curve for this particular format.

These systems include style guides, living style guides, online style guides, frameworks, CSS pre-processors, and automation tools for living style guides and UI libraries. Creating these systems is only the start of the process and effort must be made to keep them maintained or they lose all purpose and meaning. Her team strives to maintain a \u2018single source of truth\u2019 for a truly living spec. through a living style guide and prototype \u2014 all of which can improve your product design and development lifecycle.

The average time a user is prepared to spend waiting for a site to download decreases every year and with so many similar websites competing for the same space it doesn\u2019t matter how fancy your header graphics are, if your site doesn\u2019t load quickly then people will look elsewhere, and very rarely will they come back. The importance of optimization is something that is often overlooked until very late into a project\u2019s life cycle and yet it is something that should begin right at the very start \u2013 it\u2019s something that all teams should be aware of and involved in. Some of his suggestions for improving performance were:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using core bundles for common JavaScript to allow caching.<\/li>\n<li>Careful management of custom Font loading as this can be a huge blocker.<\/li>\n<li>Inlining Critical CSS and loading CSS asynchronously.<\/li>\n<li>Using pre-connect to prevent round trips.<\/li>\n<li>Avoiding the use of loaders\/spinners where possible and instead showing the user pre-content\/structure whilst the application loads. User testing has proven that this gives the illusion of faster loading speeds than just using spinners.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>He goes on to talk about how one of the challenges facing Front End Web Development today is dealing with single points of failure (SPOF), these could include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Third Party Content.<\/li>\n<li>JavaScript CDNs.<\/li>\n<li>Content CDNs.<\/li>\n<li>Accelerators.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Even the simplest website could make multiple calls to external sources and if any one of these sources fails it has the potential to bring down the entire website or application. An example of this happening was on November 12th, 2014 when Google\u2019s DoubleClick ad server took down ads for more than 55,185 websites for 5 hours. For a lot of these websites, this meant much more than just the ads disappearing, it actually led to entire sites going down as there were no fallbacks in place and with the ad server request being an SPOF, many sites would not render without it. To quote Sam Newman<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Baking in the assumption that everything can and will fail leads you to think differently about how you solve problems.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Patrick shared some suggestions for how we can solve SPOF, the most interesting of which were Service Workers, and whilst browser support is still not 100% (Chrome, Opera, and Firefox nightly), they have a bright future and came highly recommended. A Service Worker provides an extra layer between the client and the server and can be used to deliver an offline experience e.g Cached version of your site, offline pages etc.)<\/p>\n<p>He ended the talk by looking to the future and recommending we focus on offline experiences, ensuring that we always show the user something.

You can create much more complex and reliable layouts with flexbox than you can with floats, table display, or inline-block, all with far less CSS.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This talk proved to be really interesting and there was a lot of useful information to take from it.

Or is it killing creativity, homogenizing ideas and undermining the notion of original thought? This was the preamble to what quickly became one of my favourite talks of the whole conference. What made this such an exceptional talk was the balance it gave to the talk Joe Leech had given previously; it was Design vs UX and the arguments raised were of real interest.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-799\" src=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-1024x575.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"575\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-300x168.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-768x431.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-663x372.jpg 663w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-1326x745.jpg 1326w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-481x270.jpg 481w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-962x540.jpg 962w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-jeffrey-1800x1011.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>He feels that there is too much focus on creating the perfect, efficient web, that all websites look the same and he doesn\u2019t understand why, are we scared to change? He highlights how if we want to add a carousel or some parallax, that\u2019s fine \u2013 if something works for you then do it, don\u2019t be held back by trends and opinions, \u201cfuck the rules (responsibly)\u201d. To quote Matt Hill<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>I think one of the biggest problems in modern web design is that everyone keeps reinventing things that don\u2019t need reinventing<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Espen\u00a0goes on to explain how we\u00a0currently use metrics to validate everything we do, but that this is not always actually that useful. For example, when using a burger icon to indicate a menu. As we tweak the icon slightly by adding the word \u2018Menu\u2019 we improve the metrics. By making the icon larger, we improve the metrics further. By removing the burger completely and just leaving the word menu we improve the metrics even more. But now we are just left with a large word that says \u201cMenu\u201d and whilst the metrics are positive, the design has suffered as a result, there has to be a compromise somewhere or all websites end up looking the same.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-800\" src=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Espen Brunborg - Graphic Design in the 21st century: is the internet killing creativity\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-663x373.jpg 663w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-1326x746.jpg 1326w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-481x271.jpg 481w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-962x541.jpg 962w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/cms.quirksmode.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/smashing-conference-barcelona-werehere-1800x1013.jpg 1800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2016\/01\/is-the-internet-killing-creativity\/\">Is the Internet Killing Creativity<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/ebrunborg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/ebrunborg<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n"

Hiding the fallback text while the font is loading means the content is unreadable until the font loads. Some browsers have implemented a three-second timeout on font requests but performance surveys have found that many users abandon a site if it\u2019s not usable in three seconds.

A special mention must go to Smashing Magazine, for not just putting on a great conference, but also putting on a great party on Saturday night at the Estrella brewery. It was great to see so many people in attendance. Huge thanks to Beyond for letting me attend, I came back feeling refreshed and inspired \u2013 time to start planning the next one\u2026<\/p>\n"
